CS203 students,
Your graded HW8A is attached. For the most part, the class did well on this
assignment. Here are some common issues:

Do not call setData within the loop(s). This will take a long time to process.
Call this method after all the pixels have been modified in the 2D Pixel array.

Some programs were really long. I did not grade on compactness for this
assignment, but note that you can access the neighbor pixels using another
nested loop. See my solution on moodle for this version.

Part B is due tomorrow at 11 am. Some students have asked what code to
include in the report appendix: Just put your code for the 7 filters you 
wrote for Part B in the appendix.

Also, this is a reminder that we have the third midterm exam tomorrow in
class. See you then.

Tammy
